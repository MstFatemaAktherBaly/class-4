                Russia launched “massive shelling” in towns and villages on the eastern front line in the Donetsk region on Tuesday, according to a Ukrainian official.
                There is evidence of "systemic war crimes" being committed in every region where Russian forces have been deployed in Ukraine, a US State Department official said.
                More than 6,500 Ukrainian civilians have been killed since the start of the war, according to the UN. Actual figures are believed to be "considerably higher."
                With temperatures dropping, Ukraine will begin voluntary evacuations from areas in the southern Kherson region as damage to infrastructure from Russian strikes has made it perilous for residents. Ukrainian energy suppliers have also been forced to impose additional blackouts as demand for electricity outstrips supply.

                Ukraine is demanding an apology from Hungary after Prime Minister Viktor Orban was seen wearing a scarf that appeared to show parts of western Ukraine in a map of Hungary.

                The Hungarian Ambassador to Ukraine, Istvan Igyar, was summoned to the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday.
                
                The ambassador was told that it was “unacceptable for the Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orban to appear in public wearing a scarf with the image of Hungary with a part of Ukrainian territory,” according to a statement from the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
                
                “The attention of the Hungarian diplomat was drawn to the fact that such actions do not contribute to the development of good neighborly relations between Ukraine and Hungary,” MFA spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko said.
                
                    “It was emphasized that Ukraine expects an apology for this incident and hopes that in the future the Hungarian side will refrain from steps that may be regarded as disrespect for the territorial integrity of our state,” he added.
                
                Orban was pictured on his Instagram wearing the scarf at a "friendly" or unofficial football match between Greece and Hungary on Sunday.
                
                The map on Orban’s scarf appeared to represent Greater Hungary as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in the First World War. It also includes parts of Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Austria, Croatia and Slovenia. 
                
                A Romanian member of the European Parliament, Alin Mituta, called it an “irresponsible act” by Orban. 
                
                “It's a revisionist gesture that puts Orban alongside Putin, who also dreams of border changes. He should be sanctioned and isolated by EU leaders in the European Council,” Mituta said on Twitter.

                Weeks later, Russia retreated from Kherson city, the only regional capital seized in its 2022 war.

                Under a newly appointed commander, Gen Sergei Surovikin, Russia switched its strategy in October to destroying Ukraine's civilian infrastructure, destroying or damaging 40% of its power system with air raids across the country. It had failed on the battlefield, so now the Kremlin's aim was to target civilian morale.
                
                Cities across Ukraine have been hit, and two people were killed in Poland after a missile landed on a farm close to its border with Ukraine. The incident raised fears of Nato being dragged into the conflict, although the US said it was unlikely the missile had been fired by Russia.
